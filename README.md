New updates -- 
I had been added a link to download data that belongs to a sensor, For this go to sensors--- Then click on any sensor, In right side below graph
There is a link to download .csv file.
For graph I had added a simplw graph which can be seen on clicking on any sensor. We have already function for realtime plot so I am going to add Selcting time period as well as real time data funcion too. and when we click on Datas we got data from every sensor. I am trying to plot graphs for each sensor at a single graph but I can't get the values because that model of ricksahw is valid for same time data i.e if data of both sensors comes at same time. I will find a better alternet of that soon.
I had also Added an email verification method in our project. It's on by default. You can turn that off by just Uncommenting Register_user and test and commenting the uncommented Register_user and test functions.
I am learning some react.js and Node.js to make it look better as well as reduce our code.
